# Multitasq

A reimagining of the to-do list by [Justin McCandless](justinmccandless.com) written with HTML5 SVG

## Introduction

The goal of Multitasq is to create an interface to a task based workflow that goes beyond a glorified paper list and creates something easy to understand at a glance yet that can still scale down to the deepest detail.

## Usage

Multitasq is made to be intuitive and usable on touch screen devices as well as the desktop.  Here are a few helpful things you can do:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Create a new task</td>
		<td>Click any empty area on the screen.  A task will be created under the nearest parent task.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Edit an existing task</td>
		<td>Click the task and start typing.  Enter or a click confirms the edit, and escape cancels it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Mark a task as finished</td>
		<td>Click the X in the corner of a task to mark it finished and grey it out.  Clicking the X a second time will delete it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Minimize a parent task</td>
		<td>Click the minus sign (-) to minimize all child tasks of a parent.  Clicking the plus (+) after minimizing will expand the task once more.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Focus on one subtree</td>
		<td>You can bring a subtree to the front and center of Multitasq and hide all other tasks by clicking the up arrow (↑).  Clicking the down arrow (↓) will drop the task back into place again.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Your tasks will be saved to localstorage and accessible again right where you left off whenever you open your browser.  I hope to provide online storage of tasks possibly via Google Tasks integration soon...
